Practice work for TsoHa


Hi,

I wish to implement a training scheduler or a voting system implementation for coaches that they know which students are participating and what would be a customer-centric theme for participants.

If there is a proper description of course/training routine available beforehand the participants get to pick and choose with whom to take part with and at what time.

If this proves to be constricting for the coaches then a rigorous schedule will be set up and votes cast incentivize future trainings themes and would give an estimate of the most popular themes.

there is going to be tables of coaches, themes, dates and participants
